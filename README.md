# MNIST Digit Classifier (NumPy Only)

A simple neural network built from scratch using NumPy to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. This project demonstrates the core mechanics of neural networks including forward propagation, backpropagation, and weight updates without relying on deep learning frameworks.

## Features

- Neural Network implemented with NumPy only (no TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc.)
- Custom forward and backward propagation
- Trains and tests on CSV version of the MNIST dataset
- Saves learned weights to a JSON file
- Visualizes predictions on random test samples
